Project # 2
Simulation software required.
the link below is the type of simulation software id like to make the difference is i do not want virtual reality or complicated room changes etc id like an interface that will pretty much stay still except for the parts animated  .

Project # 3
Walk me through how to install mythTV on a Raspberry Pi 4, and discuss and recommend a kodi distribution, to install in tandem. Explain was is involved to integrate a remote also develop a custom front end for the Pi so that is all it is just a DVR. Subsequently support the installed Pi's as needed.

Project # 5
Write a VUE app (copy of existing deprecated angular app) 1. We are a fast growing startup in Silicon Valley www.savantcare.com 2. There is an existing angular 1.6 app I want to replace it with VUE. 3. To get hired you must pass the following exercise.... SHOW ME GITHUB REPO WITH DEMO CODE FOR https://docs.google.com/document/d/1df9ra21vm1hwm_rrimZ2j7_qb_XuT6GngGzfY4dr7IE/ 4. I am looking for a individual developer not a agency 5. If you deliver quality code you will get long term projects.  

Project # 6 (C/Assembly/Reverse Engineering)
We are looking to reverse engineer a certain file type, specifically how data is saved in it. We are using a game-theory software, that saves data with a certain file type. Through that software we can traverse the saved game theory trees, and see the info inside the file. We want those files to be reverse engineered, so that we can access the saved information without using that software. We can provide access to the software and sample files for testing. We also have a program, made by the original maker of the software, that we were using to access those files. It does not work now, after an update of the software. Reverse engineering of that exe could help too. Should have knowledge in Assembly Language

Project # 7 (Embedded)
I'm searching for a C/C++ low level programming expert. The code should be integrated or embedded into C# source code. We need to be able to use the low level C/C++ source code inside our C# software. What we were trying to do with the previous assignment you can read in the attached document. The delivery (C# source code) of that previous assignment was not solving the problem properly as functional key and dead keys and all possible combinations of them were not properly detected. However, we found a page on the internet, that seems to have the right approach but is using C/C++ source code and is unfinished itself - especially in regards to detecting all functional and dead keys. Your task is to bring the approach of the internet together with the C# source code to achieve the original goal - as described in the attached file. Here is the link: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/498623/Multi-language-on-screen-keyboa As a second outcome, please make sure that our software is able to "ask" for the status of some keys such as Shift-Lock or NUM-Lock and others if there are more of them in other cultures. Attached you can also find the results of some manually generated key-code lists to see if your outcome is complete. If you have any further questions then please let me know.

Project # 8 (Budget 350 USD)
I need a program that can convert apt files to XML and vice versa. Read this for all the info: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBE8vUOyk3NIrjKAuyT6QKxypPUjBw4ucuLfDHtyJW8/edit And then tell me how much it would cost. I put a random budget in. Also, there isn't a deadline. It can take longer than 30 days.

Project # 9 (Automation)
I’m wanting to design a windows app called Watchdog that will take someone’s information (name, up to 5 hunt codes, shipping address, credit card number/expiration/ccv, billing address, phone, email, drivers license number, resident status, resident since date, sportsman CID, password) which would either be in a CSV file that can be opened or manually enter into the app and saved, then when we select that persons record (or multiple), it will log into the website and purchase the license. All fields are alpha/numeric and can include special characters. The following steps would need to be done on the website. Some of the information is unknown with a “?” due to the website is not currently allowing purchase but there is enough information there to do an estimate based on the work to be done and we can do some initial steps and refine and test early August. 1. Windows app that can do the following: a. It can open a CSV file and be able to create a new record. b. Click Sign In link (above) c. Enter CID# d. Enter Password e. Click Sign In button f. Scroll down and click Confirm Details button g. ? (menu item to purchase a license) h. Enter Hunt Code(s) from list in app i. Click (submit?) button j. At this point you either get an error that there is no license to purchase or you go to the payment screen (there may be a message that says the Hunt Code was valid and then click a button to go to the payment screen. If an error then log off and you are done. k. Enter payment info including credit card data l. Select other required checkboxe for mailing license m. Click (submit?) button n. If successful mark the record as successful. If it fails do nothing so it can be done again later. o. If multiple records were selected the app would go on to the other records selected. p. We would also like a id/password login verification that for every record just logs in and logs off and if it fails to log in it marks the ones that are invalid. We can test the application to a point, probably step F for now, and then starting 8/4-11 refine the steps and retest. Website link to do applications: https://www.cpwshop.com/licensing.page

Project # 10
Hi. I want a Rest API to remotely restart a specific interface (automatic depending on who requests the restart) on my server. In python if its possible.

Project # 11
Need a voice bot with only one function; broadcast a message upon answer and transfer the call. The bot message would be something like: <start> <autodial/prospect.csv.row&””.send> <answer> Target: “hello.” Bot: “ Hi. This is the office of _______. “ “ Is this ___ ____?” Target: “ yes, this is___ ____. Bot: “ok..great please hold for _____.” <transfer&phoneagent> Or if the target says No this isn’t the voice bot would execute: Target:“ No’’ / “ not now” (9etc) Bot: “ ok thank you. I’ll try again later” <phone&disconnect>
